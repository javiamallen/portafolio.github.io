## ✨ Project Overview

This repository hosts a **Technical Case Study** demonstrating a complete project lifecycle: from a conceptual task (Prompt Engineering) to a fully deployed, tested, and styled production website. The core objective was to showcase proficiency in **AI-Accelerated Development** and **Full-Stack Integration (Frontend + BaaS)**.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (Engineered Components)

This project was an exercise in integrating multiple front-end technologies and serverless backend services.

| Core Skill | Technology Used | Technical Achievement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt Engineering** | `YAML Spec` / `RCC Template` | Implementation of a structured prompt template to guarantee high-quality AI output. |
| **AI Collaboration** | `Gemini` (Google AI) | Leveraged Generative AI as a Pair-Programmer for code generation and debugging. |
| **Frontend Framework** | `Bootstrap 5` | Responsive design and usage of the *mobile-first* grid system. |
| **Custom Logic** | `JavaScript` (ES6) / DOM | **Dynamic Content Injection** (Randomized quotes) on page load. |
| **Validation Logic** | `HTML5` + `Regex` | Advanced client-side form validation using custom Regular Expressions (`pattern`). |
| **Backend-as-a-Service** | `Formspree` | Secure, serverless form submission handling (BaaS). |
| **Deployment & CI/CD** | `GitHub Pages` / `Git` | Professional deployment to a public production environment via continuous integration. |
